As the test's description, I tried my best to cover a simple blog app with

- CRUD operation for Blog and it's Category, as well as User
- Searching feature for both category and post title
- Authentication system for user registration and login
- Admin dashboard that allows admin to manage all data in this application
- Authorization is a plus to manage data with their's related role

NOTE

- lara-blog folder has complete feature, I did it with laravel's blade

- As next, I tried to build again to look similar a real-world blog app
- unfortunately, I couldn't complete in the front-end with react
- If I have one more day, I can do 'blog-client 'and 'blog-api' with complete feature like 'lara-blog'
- I didn't use any third party ready-to-use library,
- I didn't follow any folder structure of my previous work and company
